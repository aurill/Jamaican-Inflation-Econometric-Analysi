# Jamaican-Inflation-Econometric-Analysis
Econometric Analysis examining the relationship between Jamaican inflation rate, the Bank of Jamaica's policy rate, treasury bill rate, and the JMD/USD monthly average exchange rate. Aimed at validating the Fisher Effect and the Taylor Rule in the context of Jamaica's economy amidst global inflation due to COVID-19


Econometric Analysis of Jamaican Financial Variables

Project Description
This project is focused on estimating the relationship between the Jamaican inflation rate, the Bank of Jamaicaâ€™s treasury bill rate, the Bank of Jamaica's policy rate, and the JMD/USD monthly average exchange rate from March 2020 to March 2022. The method used for this analysis is regression analysis, specifically by regressing the inflation rate on the other variables.

Motivation
The goal of this project is to test established economic principles like the Fisher Effect and the Taylor Rule in the context of these variables and provide relevant recommendations. The motivation for this research stems from the impact of COVID-19 on global inflation rates and the effects of specific geopolitical events.

Methodology
The core methodology employed in this research is Regression Analysis. The inflation rate was regressed upon the BOJ treasury bill rate, the BOJ policy rate, and the JMD/USD monthly average exchange rate.

Findings and Recommendations

A simple regression model revealed a positive relationship between the Jamaican inflation rate and the BOJ's treasury bill rate. If the treasury bill rate increases by one percentage point, the inflation rate is predicted to change by about 1.2%. The treasury bill rate accounted for about 65.5% of the variation in the inflation rate over the sample period (March 2020-2022), indicating a statistically significant relationship.

However, when considering the effects of the BOJ policy rate and the JMD/USD exchange rate in a multiple regression model, the treasury bill rate's impact was shown to be less significant and inverse, challenging the initial findings.

Recommendations

Despite the findings from the multiple regression, recommendations were formulated based on the simple regression outcomes, considering pre-existing knowledge about the Jamaican economic framework.

The BOJ should consider maintaining the yield/rate of the treasury bills above the current inflation rate, which can make these instruments more appealing during inflationary periods and aid in inflation reduction by absorbing excess money supply.

The BOJ should consider applying a contractionary monetary policy during periods of high inflation. By increasing interest rates, the money supply could be reduced, curbing inflation by making credit more expensive and thus moderating consumer and business spending.

Although the JA/US exchange rate's impact on inflation was found insignificant, it's recommended that BOJ collaborate with regional bodies to implement policies enhancing regional integration, ultimately reducing Jamaica's import bill and stabilizing the inflation rate by reducing exchange rate uncertainties.

This project serves as an exploration of these economic phenomena within the Jamaican context, and the findings can serve as a starting point for further research and policy formulation.
